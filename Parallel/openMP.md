# OpenMP

## Why

- parallel pragraming 
  - is hard
  - is platform-dependent
- OpenMP
  - easy to use  (`#pragma`)
  - cross platform



## What

The OpenMPÂ® API is a portable, scalable model that gives parallel programmers a simple and flexible interface for developing portable parallel applications in C/C++ and Fortran. OpenMP is suitable for a wide range of algorithms running on multicore nodes and chips, NUMA systems, GPUs, and other such devices attached to a CPU.

## How (Internal)

- `#pragma` pass to compiler
- [llvm openMP](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/openmp)  



## How to use

### Install

```shell
sudo apt-get install libomp-dev
```

### Build with CMake

```cmake
find_package(OpenMP)
if(OpenMP_CXX_FOUND)
    target_link_libraries({MyTarget} PUBLIC OpenMP::OpenMP_CXX)
endif()
```

### simple example

```cpp
  #include <cmath>
  int main()
  {
    const int size = 256;
    double sinTable[size];
    
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for(int n=0; n<size; ++n)
      sinTable[n] = std::sin(2 * M_PI * n / size);
  
    // the table is now initialized
  }
```
